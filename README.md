Serverless TODOs

- Uses React, Gatsby, Netlify, GraphQL, and FaunaDB

- Eventually want to integrate with [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar/)

- Built using Chris Biscardi's egghead.io [tutorial](https://egghead.io/playlists/building-a-serverless-jamstack-todo-app-with-netlify-gatsby-graphql-and-faunadb-53bb)
